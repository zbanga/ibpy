# GUI Frameworks #

IbPy should work with any GUI framework available to Python.  If you
have problems integrating with a particular framework, please post a
message to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ibpy-discuss) with
the details.

# Thread Models #

IbPy plays nice with three different thread models: native Python
threads, Qt3 and Qt4 threads.  If the package detects a prior import
of Qt3 or Qt4, it will select the appropriate thread class for the
(internal) EReader instance.  The only requirement is that you **must**
import Qt3 or Qt4 first.

```
  from PyQt4 import QtGui
  from ib.opt import ibConnection  ## this works
```

```
  from ib.opt import ibConnection ## wrong thread model selected!
  from qt import *
```

Other threading models (e.g., GTK) should work normally.  If you have
problems, please post a message to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ibpy-discuss)
with details.
